What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- The .git file is created. The .git file stores the metadata used by Git to track files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-The staging area is a subset of the working directory. It lets you single out what files to add it a single commit. It let you divide up work into several commits if you have done more work than you expected to do and want to separate it out into separate commits.
